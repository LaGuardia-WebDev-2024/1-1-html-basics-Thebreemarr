 <h1> the grass snake </h1>
  
<p>What lies beneath the whispering grass? <br>
    we never see them sliding past <br>
    in fields and gardens, day and night <br>
    they're always there but out of sight <br>
  slithering to, slithering fro, <br>
  as though they dont know where to go <br>
  from shiny head to shiny tail <br>
  their slimy skins wont leave a trail <br>
  their eyes see all, up and down <br>
from side to side and all around <br>
  their colour is, a grassy green <br>
  and thats probably why, they're never seen </p>
